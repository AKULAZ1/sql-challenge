# sql-challenge
I affirm that I did not rely on any sources outside of that which was provided during class time in order to complete this assignment. 
There should not be any issues, however, in the event that there are, it might be helpful to know I had to return to a prior version of pgAdmin 4 as the latest one would not open on my laptop (a Mac). I have consulted with AskBCS and they told me it should be okay, but please let me know if there are issues!
